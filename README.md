# Chatbox Tools
Chatbox Tools is a customizable, osc enabled, text interface for displaying text or relaying it to other applications (like VRC). It is an all-in-one application and runs on electron or on the web, with no setup required beyond customization! It is a work in progress and only has very basic functionality at the moment. Will update as I go (though slowly).

## Why?
I support the idea of people having many ways to communicate and do things. It is important to give people those tools and make them easily accessible. This app will give another way for people to display text in different applications like OBS or VRC. It is completely free and privacy focused. An example of a very similar application is [web captioner](https://webcaptioner.com/). However, I want to expand upon it and make this version unique!

## Todo
- better text interface window
- ability to customize text page any way you want
- speech to text (using Web Speech API)
- support more languages
- better generic osc support
- downloadable version
- web version (less features)
- pics!

## Download
I have yet to release a public version since it has basic functionality at the moment, but you are free to build it with the steps below!

## Building it yourself
### Requirements
- NodeJS 18.4.0+

### Setup
Use `npm install` to install dependencies.

Use `npm run dev` to run the application. It will run an electron version and web version. Some functionality is disabled in the web version.
